- `signed` indicates that a variable can hold negative and positive values.
- `unsigned` indicates a variable that can hold only positive numbers.
- `unsigned` is short for no signed (positive only).
- The property can be applied to most of the numeric data types including `int`, `char`, `short` and `long`.
- `signed` and  `unsigned` can standalone type specifiers, but they're used alone, they default to `int`.
- `signed` is [the default modifier for C](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18603996/signed-as-default-in-c)
- Objects of type `long` can be declared as `signed long` or `unsigned long`. `signed long` is the same as `long` because signed is the default. The same applies to `short`.â€‹
