| Measure    | Type of data | Sensitivity to extreme values | Representativeness | When to use for interpolation                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **Mean**   | Numeric      | High                          | High               | When data is **symmetric, numeric, and has few/no outliers**. Provides a balanced average.                                                                                                                       |
| **Median** | Ordinal      | Medium                        | Medium             | When data is **skewed, has outliers, or is ordinal**. More robust to extremes.                                                                                                                                   |
| **Mode**   | Any          | Low                           | Low                | When data is **categorical** or when you want the **most common/typical value**. It is always at the "peak" of the distribution, bc it's describing the point that has the most data, most repeated observations |
