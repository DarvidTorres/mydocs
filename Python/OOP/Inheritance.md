In Python, inheritance is a way to define a new class based on an existing class. The new class is called the child class and the existing class is called the parent class. The child class inherits all the attributes and methods of the parent class, and can also add new attributes and methods of its own

- Classes can inherit attributes and methods from other classes.

- Inheritance: A mechanism in which a new class is derived from an existing class. The derived class (child class) inherits attributes and methods from the base class (parent class).
