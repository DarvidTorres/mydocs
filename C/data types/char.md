# characters



In C programming language, a character variable does not contain a character value itself rather the [ASCII value](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/common/handouts/ascii.html) of the character variable. The ascii value represents the character variable in numbers, and each character variable is assigned with some number range from 0 to 127. For example, the ascii value of 'A' is 65.
