# The Fetch-Execute Cycle

- The Fetch-Execute cycle is a procedure that dictates how computer systems retrieve instructions from [[memory]] for the [[memory#CPU|CPU]] to interpret and execute.

The cycle is split into two parts and four steps:
- Parts:
	1. Instruction time (i-time)
		- Instructions are retrieved from [[memory#RAM|RAM]] and decoded by [[memory#CPU|CPU]].
	2. Execution time (e-time)
		- Program instructions are executed by the CPU with processed data being stored.
- Steps:
	- Fetch
	- Decode
	- Execute
	- Store
