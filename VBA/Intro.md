- Blocks of code or programs are called modules.
- A VBA module consists of Sub procedures.
	- Snipets of code to perform some action on or with objects
- A VBA module can also have Function procedures.
	- Returns a single value
	- Can be invoked as from another VBA procedure or as afucntion in a worksheet formula
- VBA manupulates objects:
	- workbook
	- worksheet
	- cell range
	- chart
	- shape
	- etc.
- Objects have hirearchy

- Collection objects are objects themselves
	- Worksheets collection (in a workbook)
	- Charts collection (in a workbook)
- To call objects specify its position in the hirearchy
	- `Application.Workbooks("Book1.xlsx").Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("A1")
- Objects have properties that can be read and written
	- `Range` object has `Value` and `Address`
	- `Chart` object has `Title` and `Type`
- To point to properties use the dot operator:
	- `Application.Workbooks("Book1.xlsx").Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("A1").Value
	- Use `=` operator for variable assignments
		- `Interest = Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("A1").Value`
- Objects have methods
	- A method is an *action* upon an object.
	- `Range` has method `ClearContents`
- To call method use dot operator:
	- `Application.Workbooks("Book1.xlsx").Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("A1").ClearContents
- VBA is a programming language
