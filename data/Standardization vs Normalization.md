- Normalization transforms your data into a range between 0 and 1.
- Standardization transforms your data such that the resulting distribution has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1

Normalization/standardization are designed to achieve a similar goal, which is to create features that have similar ranges to each other. We want that so we can be sure we are capturing the true information in a feature, and that we don't over weigh a particular feature just because its values are much larger than other features.
