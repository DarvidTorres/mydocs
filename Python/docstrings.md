Python docstrings are the string literals that appear right after the definition of a function, method, class, or module.
- For triple-quoted strings, always use double quote characters to be consistent with the docstring convention in [PEP 257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/)

## function docstrings

The docstring for a function or method should summarize its behavior and document its arguments, return value(s), side effects, exceptions raised, and restrictions on when it can be called (all if applicable). Optional arguments should be indicated. It should be documented whether keyword arguments are part of the interface.
