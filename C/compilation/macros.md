A macro is a fragment of code which has been given a name. Whenever the name is used, it is replaced by the contents of the macro.

You may define any valid identifier as a macro, even if it is a [[Overview#keywords|C keyword]]. The [[preprocessor|preprocessor]] does not know anything about keywords.

By convention, macro names are written in uppercase.

# Object-like

An object-like macro is an identifier which will be replaced by a code fragment.

It is called object-like because it looks like a data object in code that uses it. They are most commonly used to give symbolic names to numeric constants.

You create macros with the `#define` directive. `#define` is followed by the name of the macro and then the token sequence it should be an abbreviation for, which is variously referred to as the macroâ€™s body, expansion or replacement list.

Synaxis:

```C
#define <MACRO_NAME> <token>
```

Examples:

```C
#define MAX 100
#define MIN 1
#define GRAVITY 9.8
#define NAME "Scaler"
#define TRUE 1
#define FALSE 0
```

The C preprocessor will recognize and expand macros.

The following object-like definition causes the preprocessor to replace all subsequent instances of the identifier `COUNT` with the constant `1000` : `#define COUNT 1000`. If the statement `int arry[COUNT];` appears after this definition and in the same file as the definition, the preprocessor would change the statement to  `int arry[1000];` in the output of the preprocessor.

Example:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

#define MY_MACRO 3

void main() {
    int a = MY_MACRO;
    printf("%d", a);
}
```

# function-like

To define a function-like macro, use the same `#define` directive, and put parentheses immediately (no space in between) after the macro name.

Syntax:

```C
#define <MACRO_NAME>() <token>
```

Function-like macros can take arguments, like true functions.

To define a macro that uses arguments, insert parameters between the pair of parentheses in the macro definition that make the macro function-like. The parameters must be valid C identifiers, separated by commas and optionally whitespace.

Example:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

#define SQR(c) ((c) * (c))

void main() {
    int a = SQR(3 + 1);
    printf("%d", a);
}
```

A common error would be to write:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

#define SQR(c) c*c

void main() {
    int a = SQR(3 + 1);
    printf("%d", a);
}
```

As the preprocessor changes the code: `SQRT(3 + 1)` into `3+1*3+1`, and thus, not yielding the desired result.

The above, is an example of [macro pitfalls](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Macro-Pitfalls.html#Macro-Pitfalls).

# chain-like macros

We can use macros inside macro definitions.

Example:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#define PI 3.14 //object like macro
#define Area(r) (PI*(r*r)) // function like macro

void main()
{
    float radius = 2.5; // declaration and initialization of radius
    float area = Area(radius); // declaring and assigning the value to area
    printf("Area of circle is %f\n", area); // Printing the area of circle
}
```

# Predefined Macros

- Some object-like macros are [predefined](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Predefined-Macros.html#Predefined-Macros); use them without supplying their definitions.
- Predefined macros aren't modifiable.

Examples:
| Macro      | Feature                                                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------|
| \__LINE\__ | Contains the current line number on which this macro is used.       |
| \__FILE\__ | Contains the name of the file where the current program is present. |
| \__DATE\__ | Contains the current date in MMM DD YYYY format.                    |
| \__TIME\__ | Contains the current time in HH:MM format.                          |
| \__STDC\__ | Is defined as 1 when there is a successful compilation.             |

```C
#include <stdio.h>

void main()
{
    printf("This is line no.: %d\n", __LINE__);
    printf("Name of this file: %s\n", __FILE__);
    printf("Current Date: %s\n", __DATE__);
    printf("Current Time: %s\n", __TIME__);
    printf("Compilation success: %d\n", __STDC__);
}
```
