- You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
	- **A parameter is a variable in a function definition.** **It is a placeholder and hence does not have a concrete value.** **An argument is a value passed during function invocation**.
- A function can return data as a result.
- Function objects are created by function definitions.

- A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
- The only operation on a function object is to call it: `func(argument-list)`.

- Python provides the following types of functions:
	- Built-in functions
		- These functions are always available.
	- Functions defined in built-in modules
	- User-defined functions
