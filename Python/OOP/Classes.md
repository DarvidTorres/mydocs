Classes creates a new [[data types|type]] of object, allowing new _instances_ of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.

A class is a collection of objects.  Unlike primitive data structures, classes are data structures that the user defines.
- Even the datatypes in Python, like tuples,dictionaries, etc. are classes.

- Classes are created at runtime, and can be modified further after creation.
- Class names should normally use the CapWords convention.

syntax:
```Python
class <ClassIdentifier>:
	<suite>
```

Example:
```Python

```

When we define a class, only the description or a blueprint of the object is created. There is no memory allocation until we create its object. The objector instance contains real data or information.
