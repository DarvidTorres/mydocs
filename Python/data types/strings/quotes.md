# quotes

To quote a quote, we need to “escape” it, by preceding it with `\`. Alternatively, we can use the other type of quotation marks:

```Python
print('doesn\'t') # use \' to escape the single quote...
print("doesn't") # or use double quotes instead
print('"Yes," they said')
print("\"Yes,\" they said.")
print('"Isn\'t," they said.')
```
