### `.SD` is not exactly the same as `DT`

- `.SD` is a **data.table**, but it only exists _inside the `j` expression_.
- `DT` is the whole object, visible everywhere.

So while they can look similar, `.SD` is a _special, temporary view_ of your data.
### The 3 core slots

`DT[i, j, by]` has these main roles:
- `i` → which **rows** to keep
- `j` → what to **do/return**
- `by` → how to **group** the rows
---
### Where `.SD` and `.SDcols` fit

- `.SD` lives **inside `j`**. It’s the data table of columns you can operate on.
- `.SD` contains all the columns _except the grouping columns_ by default.
- `.SDcols` is an **argument**, not a slot. It tells data.table: _“Only include these columns in `.SD`.”_
- `.SDcols`. It accepts either column names or column indices.
	- For example, `.SDcols = c("a", "b")` ensures that `.SD` contains only these two columns for each group.

```r
DT[, lapply(.SD, mean), .SDcols = c("a", "b", "c")]
```
- `i` is missing (so all rows).
- `j` = `lapply(.SD, mean)` (apply mean to each column in `.SD`).
- `by` is missing (so no grouping).
- `.SDcols` just restricts which columns `.SD` contains.

Think of it like:
- `i` → rows
- `j` → expression
- `by` → groups
- `.SDcols` → which columns are “in scope” for `.SD`

### 1. What `.SD` is

- `.SD` is a **data.table** object.
- And here’s the trick: a `data.table` is also a **list underneath** (just like a `data.frame` is).
- Each column is an element of that list.

So `.SD` behaves like a list of columns when you pass it to `lapply()`.

When you do:

```r
DT[, lapply(.SD, mean)]
```

`lapply()` looks at `.SD`, sees it’s list-like, and applies `mean` to each element (i.e., each column).

---

### 3. Confirm it yourself

Try this with a toy table:

```r
library(data.table)
DT <- data.table(a = 1:3, b = 4:6)

DT[, { print(is.data.table(.SD)); print(is.list(.SD)); NULL }]
```

You’ll see `.SD` is both a `data.table` **and** a `list`.
