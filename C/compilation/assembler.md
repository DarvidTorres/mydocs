The Assembler is a program that converts assembly language into machine language.

The assembler takes as its source code an [assembly language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) program; this is also a file of ASCII characters; it used this to produce machine code.

The Assembler operates in two main phases:
1. Analysis Phase
	- Validates the syntax of the code, checks for errors, and creates a symbol table.
2. Synthesis Phase
	- Converts the assembly language instructions into machine code, using the information from the Analysis Phase.
