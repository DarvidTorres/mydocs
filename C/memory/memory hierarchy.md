- The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is basically a huge network of logic gates.
	- It is also known as a processor or microprocessor.
	- Inside a CPU there are thousands of microscopicÂ transistors.
- The CPU chip contains two separate modules: registers and a memory cache.
- Data transfer occurs between adjacent memory levels.
- The CPU process data from its registers.
	- This is the only place where the processor can take data for calculations.

- The motherboard is the printed circuit board that connects computer components.
