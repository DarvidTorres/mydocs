- Conditional [[compilation]] implies that source code is compiled if certain condition(s) hold true.
- Using directives, we can include or exclude parts of the program according to various conditions.
- Directives control the selective compilation of portions of the program code.
- Six directives are available to control conditional compilation.
	- Directives can be nested.

# directives

In almost every program we see a few lines at the top of the program preceded by a hash `(#`) sign. These lines are preprocessed by the compiler before actual compilation begins.
