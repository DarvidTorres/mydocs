# directives

In almost every program we see a few lines at the top of the program preceded by a hash `(#`) sign. These lines are preprocessed by the compiler before actual compilation begins.

- Directives are instructions to the preprocessor which allow additional actions to be taken on the source code before it is compiled into object code.
- Directives are not part of the C language itself.
- Directives begin with the has (`#`) symbol.
- Directives can be nested.
