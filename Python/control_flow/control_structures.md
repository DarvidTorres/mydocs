The main control structures are conditional branching, which enables to choose the code to be executed based on some conditions, and loops, in which a series of statements can be executed repeatedly.

# suite

a block of code, that is, a sequence of one or more statements, is called a suite. Because some of Python’s syntax requires that a suite be present, Python provides the keyword `pass` which is a statement that does nothing and that can be used where a suite is required (or where we want to indicate that we have considered a particular case) but where no processing is necessary.
