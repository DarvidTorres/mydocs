- A block of code, that is, a sequence of one or more statements, is called a suite.

Because some of Python’s syntax requires that a suite be present, Python provides the keyword `pass` which is a statement that does nothing and that can be used where a suite is required (or where we want to indicate that we have considered a particular case) but where no processing is necessary.
