The membership operators in Python help us determine whether an item is a member of a given container type object.
- Python has two membership operators: `in` and `not in`.
- Use in operator to check whether a substring is present in a bigger [[Python/data types/strings/strings|string]], any item is present in a [[lists|list]] or [[tuples|tuple]], or a sub-list or sub-tuple is included in a [[lists|list]] or [[tuples|tuple]].

Example:
```Python
string = "Hello World!"
print("Hello" in string)
print("World!" not in string)
```
