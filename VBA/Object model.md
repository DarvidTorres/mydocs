There are many objects in the hierarchy.

Application

	- Chart
	- Name
	- VBProject
	- Window

		- Comment
		- Hyperlink
		- Name
		- PageSetup

# Referencing

To refer to a Workbook object, use dot operator following hierarchy structure.

>You can start with the Application object like in the following code:
>`Application.Workbooks.Item("Book1").Path`

All collection objects have an Item property to get to a singular instance of an object they collect. A collection’s Item property takes one argument. That argument can be a string (enclosed in double quotes) or an integer.

The following code returns the first worksheet of the second workbook:
`Application.Workbooks.Item(2).Worksheets.Item(1)`
Worksheets are ordered the same way as in Excel. The left-most worksheet is the first worksheet in the collection.

Item is the default property for every collection object making the following code equivalent:

```VBA
Application.Workbooks.Item("Book1.xlsx").Worksheets.Item(2).Range("A1").Value
Application.Workbooks("Book1.xlsx").Worksheets(2).Range("A1").Value
```

The Application object is always assumed.

```VBA
Application.Workbooks("Book1.xlsx").Worksheets(2).Range("A1").Value
Workbooks("Book1.xlsx").Worksheets(2).Range("A1").Value
```

We can assume active workbook:

```VBA
Workbooks("Book1.xlsx").Worksheets(2).Range("A1").Value
Worksheets(2).Range("A1").Value
```

We can assume active worksheet:

```VBA
Worksheets(2).Range("A1").Value
Range("A1").Value
```

You almost never need the Application object in your reference, but you may need the Workbook
object.
