The first step of launching a program is to load it into Random-access memory (RAM).

- The single unit of the computer memory is a byte.
- A bit is the smallest amount of information you cannot divide.
- A byte is a memory block of eight bits.
- CPU cannot refer to a single bit.
	- The reasons are historical.
		- The primary task of the first computers was arithmetic calculations and a single bit is not enough to store a number in memory.
		- So, the computer needs memory blocks to store numbers.

- Memory is a (list) sequence of locations (bytes) to store [[types#value range|data values]].
- Storing locations (bytes) are assigned unique memory [[address|addresses]].

The Stack and the Heap are two memory areas located in the computerâ€™s RAM.
