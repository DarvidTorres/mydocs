- Strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.
- Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.
- strings are **immutable**.
- **PEP8**: When a string contains single or double [[quotes|quote]] characters, however, use the other one to avoid backslashes in the string. It improves readability.

```python
print("Alice n' Bob")
```
