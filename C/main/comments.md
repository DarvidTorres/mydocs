Comments can be singled-lined or multi-lined.

Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (`//`).
Multi-line comments start with `/*` and ends with `*/`.

```c
// This is a comment
printf("Hello World!");
printf("Hello World!"); // This is a comment
/* The code below will print the words Hello World!
to the screen, and it is amazing */
```

Comments donâ€™t nest.

`/* does not /* work */ */`
